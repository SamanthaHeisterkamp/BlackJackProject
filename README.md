# BlackJackProject
  Blackjack Project is a functional command line Blackjack game. I build classes , implemented methods, fields,
  to tie the Blackjack game together, and function in the App. I used a Blackjack UML Diagram that was provided and expanded on it to meet the expectations of the game.  
# Description
Blackjack is a simple game that prompts the player to hit or stand after the dealer deals two cards to player and dealer. The players cards are displayed along with the value, the dealers first card is not shown, and the second is flipped for player to see. The player is prompted to either hit or stand depending on if they are close to 21. Hitting yields a new players card. Standing is pushed to the dealers turn. The dealer is then prompted to hit or stand. The dealer will hit for anything under 17 and stand at anything above 17. If in the end, the player and dealer have the same value, it is a draw. If the player ends with 21, the player wins with blackjack. If the dealers value is 21, the dealer wins with blackjack. At the end of the game, the user is prompted if they would like to play again. If yes, the game clears and starts over, if no, the game is over and the application is terminated.

# Lessons Learned 
This project helped solidify implementing methods in other classes. Many of the methods in this application came easier as writing the code went along. I used the UML diagram to help keep me organized while writing. Overall, I feel positive in this code more so than the last. While the process was confusing at first, writing the if statements all nestled with more if statements, it seemed to work and make sense. I feel more confident in writing the nestled if statements than I did before. This project took me two days to write, on and off. While I am not as proficient as I would like to be, I know with enough time, I can figure it out how to write code like this program.
